                    <p>
                    As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, we face complex ethical questions. How do we ensure AI systems are fair, transparent, and accountable? How can we mitigate biases and prevent AI from perpetuating existing inequalities? These questions necessitate thoughtful regulation, transparent decision-making processes, and ongoing conversations to shape AI's ethical frameworks.
