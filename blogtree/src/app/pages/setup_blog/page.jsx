                <p class="title is-size-4">1. A display monitor</p>
                <div className="content">
                    <p>
                    Using a monitor really increases productivity. Having a monitor allows you to have different screens opened at once which reduces the stress related to opening and closing a screen when you use and are done. Most tech folks would recommend a 27 inch moniter. In my perspective, it is a great choice due to the fact that it is the perfect size, neither big nor small, just right.

                <p class="title is-size-4">2. A keyboard and mouse</p>
                <div className="content">
                    <p>
                    A keyboard and mouse are the most basic but important periphals one must have as part of their setup. They allow one to execute tasks easily with less stress. If you are using a laptop I would recommend getting a laptop stand to  get the best experience. There are different types of keyboards. There are mechanical keyboards and wireless keyboards. I would recommend buying the one you feel would work best for you.

                <p class="title is-size-4">3. A mini storage tray</p>
                <div className="content">
                    <p>
                    Having a mini storage tray can be of great use. You can arrange things like your keys, sdcards, pens and other things that would need a good place like a tray to be kept in.
                    The size of your desk would determine the type of tray you can buy for yourself.Pick one that matches your preference and go for it

                <p class="title is-size-4">4. A desk mat</p>
                <div className="content">
                    <p>
                    A dest mat is one of the most underrated things for a desk setup. It makes a desksetup have a more organised look. It also srves as a pad for the mouse on rough surfaces. It also prevents the bottom of your devices from wearing off.
                    They come in different colours and sizes. I would recommend a desk mat since it serves the purpose of a mouse pad as well

                    Making your desk setup look aesthetically pleasing makes it enjoyable to work at. Neat and organised tables with a monitor allows one to be free and be able to express their thoughts.
                    You could always search on Pinterest for ideas and youtube for tutorials as well.
